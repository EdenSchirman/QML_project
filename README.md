# QML_project
This work as been done as a part of course in deep learning. The project restored previous work done by IBM in quantum machine learning. 
Specifically, I followed Zoufal et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00043) and started with their tutorial (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/35ff38c7ffe004bf4f5f1f2e964feb4c88d32b58/tutorials/machine_learning/04_qgans_for_loading_random_distributions.ipynb).
